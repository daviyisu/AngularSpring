# AngularSpring
Web application that uses Angular as front-end and Spring as back-end

# Angularclient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.6.

## Angular development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Spring development server

Run `mvn spring-boot:run` for a dev server. Spring listens to port 8080

You may need to run the front and the back in two separate IDE windows (at least that what I need to do in IntelliJ).
